# Parallel Programming in Python
The source code for the assignments I did for a course on parallel programming in Python.

I should note that the code for this is basically a copy of the code that was in the class.
I typed it myself and made sure that it could run. But there isn't much in the way of innovations.

The course in question is here: TODO - ADD LINK
